The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript

TypeScript's union and intersection classes facilitate intelligent handling of various data types. Let's examine their functions and benefits!

Union Types: What Are They?
A variable can have multiple kinds thanks to a union type. The statement is analogous to "This box can hold either a car, a doll, or a robot."

Example:
typescript
Copy code
function greet(name: string | number) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

greet("Alice"); // Hello, Alice
greet(42); // Hello, 42
Here, name can be either a string or a number.

What's the point of using it?

Working with many types in one location is possible!
Types of Intersections: What Are They?
Several kinds are combined into one by an intersection type. Such a statement would be equivalent to "This box must hold both a car and a robot."

Example:
typescript
Copy code
type Car = { wheels: number; color: string };
type Robot = { name: string; canSpeak: boolean };

type CarRobot = Car & Robot;

const carRobot: CarRobot = {
  wheels: 4,
  color: "red",
  name: "RoboCar",
  canSpeak: true
};

console.log(carRobot);
Here, CarRobot has all the properties of both Car and Robot.


What's the point of using it?

Different things can be combined into one!
A Brief Recap
Types of Unions: There are numerous types of variables. (number | string)
Types of Intersections: A variable has all properties from multiple types. (Car & Robot)
